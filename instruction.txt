Create a fastapi app exposing an only one endpoint to create users with the following data:
1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Age
4. Email
5. Height

Notes:
- Make sure to use the right payload content type
- Use the appropriate status codes
- Use in-memory storage to store responses
- Add a CORS middleware to allow only http:localhost:8000 (your localhost origin)
- Add a logger middleware to print to the console the time taken for a request to complete.
- Put your code in a Github repo.
